# <img src="public/ystorian.svg" style="height:1em;"> Ystorian URL Shortener

URL shortener app for [Ystorian](https://www.ystorian.com).

Project stopped since Chrome complains about [⬣.tk](https://⬣.tk) being a potential unsafe site, due to:
* International Domain Names (IDN) with emoji encoded as punny code (⬣.tk is encoded as xn--45i.tk)
* dotTK (.tk) domains have a bad reputation.
